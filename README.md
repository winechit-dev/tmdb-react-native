A simple movie database app built with React Native and TypeScript, using The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## Features

- Browse popular, top-rated, and now playing movies
- Search for movies
- View detailed movie information including:
  - Movie poster and backdrop images
  - Overview and synopsis
  - Release date and runtime
  - Ratings and vote count
  - Genres
  - Budget and revenue information
  - Production companies
- Responsive grid layout
- Pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- React Native development environment set up
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Get your TMDB API key:
   - Go to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
   - Create an account and log in
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Create a new API key (v3 auth)

4. Setup environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
   - Open `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```bash
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p
   ```

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
